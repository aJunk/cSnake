# cSnake

A simple snake-like minigame for terminal, written in C.
Ncurses is used for graphics and input.

The aim of this little project is to train rapid software prototyping by creating little minigames/widgets in short spans of time (e.g. on a train).
It also helps not to get too rusty.

## Prerequisites

You must have ncurses installed.

## Compiling

With ncurses installed just compile with:

```
gcc snake.c -o snake -lncurses
```
